# PhoneBricking
The definitve guide to bricking your phone and lowering screen time for productivity

I will try to update this repo as often as I can as new information comes out

I have also included two scriptable apps in this repo

The majority of resources comes from my own experiences, academic research, and the resources below:
1. [Healthy Screens](https://www.healthyscreens.com/) - the largest global study on smartphone research
2. [Nathan Laundry](https://www.youtube.com/@nathanlaundry) - content creator focused on attention economy research and self hosting

### What is Decluttering / Phone Bricking


### Why Declutter?


### Methods for Decluttering
- Note: This list assumes that you don't need your phone on you at all times

#### Screen

Grayscale:
- To turn your phone grayscale:
  - Settings -> Accessibility -> Display & Text Size -> Color Filters -> Color Filters On -> Grayscale

Grayscale works so well because you will not get dopamine from your phone. [Holte et al., 2020,2021](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03623319.2020.1737461) found when college students used grayscale, screen time dropped by ~40 minutes a day. They found "Bright colors are gratifying to smartphone users, resulting in more time being spent on smartphones."

If on a higher end iPhone or Android:
- Change from 120hz to 60hz
- Turn off Always-on Display

Kill Animations: 
- Turns off the smooth animations that make it satisfying to use your phone
- Settings -> Accessibility -> Motion -> Reduce Motion = On

'Flatter' Text:
- Makes the phone keyboard and other parts of the phone look worse
- Settings -> Accessibility -> Display & Text Size -> Reduce Transparency

All of these methods work to make using your phone less satisfying to keep you off of it more. 

#### Block the App Store
- Blocking the app store will make it easier to be off your phone and prevent you from downloading apps that would otherwise distract you
- Settings -> Screen Time -> Content & Privacy Restrictions ->
  - Content & Privacy Restrictions On
  - iTunes & App Store Purchases->
    - Installing Apps -> Don't Allow
    - In-app Purchases -> Don't Allow

#### Reduce Notifications
- Create a Do Not Disturb setting and keep it on 24/7
  - Disable all non-essential notifications (sounds, banners, and vibrations)
  - Reducing the frequency of notifications can reduce stress
    - [Fitz et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563219302596?via%3Dihub)
- Batch when you check notifications
  - Set 3 times throughout the day where you respond to all of your notifications, this will keep you from constantly picking up and putting down your phone (psychological trick similar to a slot machine!)

#### Enable Screen Time Tracking
- Setting limits (and sticking to them) can be a very effective tool in reducing screen time
- Settings -> Screen time -> Turn on screen time

#### Keep Your Phone Away While Sleeping
- Keep your phone on silent and out of reach when going to bed
- Use an analog alarm clock
- Avoiding phone use at night may improve sleep and quality of life
  - [Hughes & Burke, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563218301523?via%3Dihub)

#### Hide Apps That You are Addicted To
- Remove social media from your home screen, and make all of your apps harder to accessible by adding multiple pages between your home page and your 'all apps' page.
- Or better yet delete them :)

#### Make Your Phone Less Accessible
- Keep your phone on silent and out of reach, preferably in another room
- Multiple studies have shown that being able to see your phone near you can reduce cognitive performance
  - [Ward et al., 2017](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/691462)
  - [Glass & Kang, 2018](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01443410.2018.1489046)

#### Make Your Phone Harder to Unlock
- Disable Face ID and use a password instead
- Delay before accessing your phone can reduce usage
  - [Kim et al., 2019](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300927)
 
#### Lower Your Screen Brightness
- In a similar vein to grayscaling your phone, lowering the brightness and turning on the blue light filter can lower your screen time
- Settings -> Display & Brightness -> Lower "Brightness"

#### Move Phone Tasks to Computers
- If you can do a task on a computer, even social media, do it on a computer
- Social media use primarliy occurs on smartphones and may be more likely to produce habitual use compared to computers.
  - [Oulasvirta et al., 2011](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00779-011-0412-2)

#### Leave Your Phone at Home When You Can
- Leave your phone at home when you do not need it
- Not having a phone accessible will prevent it from interfering with other activities such as in-person social interactions
  - [Kushlev et al., 2019](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963721419847200)  

#### Learning to be bored / Meditation
- Young people are never bored. We are constantly flooded w/ addictive content to steal our attention
- Boredom is necessary in the pursuit of productivity and without it, we rot
  - [Bench & Lench, 2013](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-328X/3/3/459)
- Learning to consitently medidate is one of the best methods to improving your attention span
  - [Zeidan et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053810010000681)

#### Analog Options
- As mentioned earlier, an analog alarm clock will keep you off of your phone in the morning
- Our phones have become a central 'do-everything' machine. De-centralizing it and switching to analog options for things like your camera, notes, games, etc. Will reduce the time you spend on your phone and keep you from getting disctracted.

#### Brick Phones
- There are several brick phones and getting something like a flip phone is the easiest way to brick your phone and keep you off of it. However, it does not come without sacrifices.

#### Self Hosting
- My personal favorite way of being off my phone, self-hosting!
- Entertainment apps are inherently engineered in a way to keep you on them, because that's how companies make money. Creating your own way to host entertainment with open source applications like jellyfin are the perfect way to combat this.
- Projects like this are also a good way to keep you off your phone because they can take quite a bit of time.
