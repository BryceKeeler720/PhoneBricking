### What is Decluttering / Phone Bricking


### Why Declutter?


### Methods for Decluttering

#### Screen

Grayscale:
- To turn your phone grayscale:
  - Settings -> Accessibility -> Display & Text Size -> Color Filters -> Color Filters On -> Grayscale

Grayscale works so well because you will not get dopamine from your phone. [Holte et al., 2020,2021](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03623319.2020.1737461) found when college students used grayscale, screen time dropped by ~40 minutes a day. They found "Bright colors are gratifying to smartphone users, resulting in more time being spent on smartphones."

If on a higher end iPhone or Android:
- Change from 120hz to 60hz
- Turn off Always-on Display

Kill Animations: 
- Turns off the smooth animations that make it satisfying to use your phone
- Settings -> Accessibility -> Motion -> Reduce Motion = On

'Flatter' Text:
- Makes the phone keyboard and other parts of the phone look worse
- Settings -> Accessibility -> Display & Text Size -> Reduce Transparency

All of these methods work to make using your phone less satisfying to keep you off of it more. 

#### Block the App Store
- Blocking the app store will make it easier to be off your phone and prevent you from downloading apps that would otherwise distract you
- Settings -> Screen Time -> Content & Privacy Restrictions ->
  - Content & Privacy Restrictions On
  - iTunes & App Store Purchases->
    - Installing Apps -> Don't Allow
    - In-app Purchases -> Don't Allow
